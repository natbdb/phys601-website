Welcome to my research page!

I am a graduate student at McGill University, working with [Prof. Katelin Schutz](https://katelinschutz.com/) at the intersection between particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology.

If you'd like to learn more about me, you can find an introduction to [my research](./research/index.md), some info on some [recent projects](./projects/index.md) and some more info [about me](./about/index.md).
