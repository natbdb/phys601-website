# Cylindrical Solutions of the Einstein Field Equations

For my Bachelor's theis at Khalifa University, I worked under the supervision of Dr. Davide Baticto investigate asymptotically flat exact cylindrical solutions of the Einstein field equations. 

I first studued the reduction of the vacuum field equations to the Ernst equation, a single complex PDE, and then obtained and analyzed new solutions by reducing the Ernst
quation to the simpler Laplace equation. I then used an integral transform called the Hankel transform in order to solve the Laplace equation and obtain a metric that describes the geometry of spacetime. Together with Dr. Batic, we found three new solutions that exhibit naked singularities, meaning singularities that are not hidden by an event horizon, which is the case for the well known Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions that represent black holes. 

We analyzed their geometries and pointed out that
these solutions could be the exterior spacetime regions of some cylindrically symmetric matter configurations. In addition to highlighting the role of integral transforms in the derivation of exact solutions, our study also stressed the importance of studying naked singularities in general relativity. In fact, the Kerr metric is the only known well-behaved axisymmetric solution, meaning that it does not contain naked singularities. The formal proof of the uniqueness of the Kerr metric in terms of containing singularities hidden behind event horizons is still an open question. Our work resulted in a [journal publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10543).
