## Research Interests

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a theory that describes subatomic elementary particles
and their interactions, and is the most precise and comprehensive framework in scientific history that
describes nature at the fundamental level. However, important open questions remain that hint at new
physics beyond the SM, including its failure to account for dark matter (DM). Although DM has not been
directly detected so far, indirect astrophysical and cosmological observations indicate that it constitutes
85% of all matter in the universe and is composed of one or more new particles [^1]. Understanding the
particle nature of DM is therefore one of the big pillars in fundamental physics research.

A number of extensions to the SM containing new particles as potential DM candidates have been
proposed, and multiple approaches have been explored to constrain their mass and interaction strength
with SM particles. Recently, one of the most promising avenues to constrain DM has been through astro-
physical and cosmological probes. Making use of the increasingly precise data from advanced telescopes,
it is possible to look for imprints of DM on astrophysical systems and on the evolution of the universe as
a whole. 

Although this research avenue has been explored for some time[^2] [^3], there has been recent research pointing out previously neglected in-medium effects, i.e. effects which arise from the DM particle interactions with nontrivial astrophysical environments. In fact, previous research usually assumed that these processes occurred in vaccuum, and taking these effects into account can lead to new constraints on the properties of new DM particles. My current research is focussed in this area, revisiting constraints on new particles and incorporating these in-medium effects in the framework of finite temperature field theory [^4]. This will lead to new constraints on new DM particles, which will advance our understanding of DM candidates and contribute to the search for
beyond the SM physics by informing experimental searches as well as directions in theory.
