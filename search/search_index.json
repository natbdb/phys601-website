The style is refreshingly experimental in both novels, with most chapters written in a distinctive style and going as far as a whole chapter composed of a PowerPoint slide, one as a magazine article, and one as a series of emails and messages!

However, important open questions remain that hint at new physics beyond the SM, including its failure to account for dark matter (DM). Although DM has not been directly detected so far, indirect astrophysical and cosmological observations indicate that it constitutes 85% of all matter in the universe and is composed of one or more new particles <sup>1</sup>. Understanding the particle nature of DM is therefore one of the big pillars in fundamental physics research.</p> <p>A number of extensions to the SM containing new particles as potential DM candidates have been proposed, and multiple approaches have been explored to constrain their mass and interaction strength with SM particles. Recently, one of the most promising avenues to constrain DM has been through astro- physical and cosmological probes. Making use of the increasingly precise data from advanced telescopes, it is possible to look for imprints of DM on astrophysical systems and on the evolution of the universe as a whole. </p> <p>Although this research avenue has been explored for some time<sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup>, there has been recent research pointing out previously neglected in-medium effects, i.e. effects which arise from the DM particle interactions with nontrivial astrophysical environments. In fact, previous research usually assumed that these processes occurred in vaccuum, and taking these effects into account can lead to new constraints on the properties of new DM particles. My current research is focussed in this area, revisiting constraints on new particles and incorporating these in-medium effects in the framework of finite temperature field theory <sup>4</sup>. This will lead to new constraints on new DM particles, which will advance our understanding of DM candidates and contribute to the search for beyond the SM physics by informing experimental searches as well as directions in theory.</p>"},{"location":"research/#publications","title":"Publications","text":"<p>A full list of my publications can be found here.</p>"},{"location":"research/#highlights","title":"Highlights","text":"<p>Here are some highlights of my current and past research projects. </p> <ul> <li>Anomaly Detection for LIGO</li> <li>Cylindrical Solutions of the Einstein Field Equations</li> </ul>"},{"location":"research/#references","title":"References","text":"<ol> <li> <p>G.

In particular, I built  and evaluated transformer-based autoencoder models to detect anomalous signals in a source-agnostic manner. </p> <p>This method consisted in training a model with data from the noise of the LIGO detector, a signal that the model learns to predict accurately. Running this model while the detector is operating and comparing its predicted noise signal with real data then allows us to identify \"anomalies\", i.e. signals that are very different than the expected noise. As it does not rely on the previous knowledge of signal shapes from specific sources, this is  a method that could extend LIGO\u2019s reach to unknown exotic sources. </p> <p>My resulting final transformer model  performed better than a previously developed recurrent model, prompting the group to further investigate transformers.

I then used an integral transform called the Hankel transform to solve the Laplace equation and obtain a metric that describes the geometry of spacetime. Together with Dr. Batic, we found three new solutions that exhibit naked singularities, meaning singularities that are not hidden by an event horizon. </p> <p>We analyzed their geometries and pointed out that these solutions could be the exterior spacetime regions of some cylindrically symmetric matter configurations. In addition to highlighting the role of integral transforms in the derivation of exact solutions, our study also stressed the importance of studying naked singularities in general relativity. In fact, the well known Kerr metric is the only known well-behaved axisymmetric solution, meaning that it does not contain naked singularities, and the formal proof of the uniqueness of the Kerr metric in this aspect is still an open question.
